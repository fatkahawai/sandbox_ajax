js.sandbox.ajax

an example of a JSONP request - an ajax request which returns a JSON object which can be directly referenced.

ajax_server.js is a node.js application. its an http server which servers html and js files,
and also responds to JSONP requests

to start, open terminal window and run node with the ajax_server.js file as argument
    > node ajax_server.js

this starts the http server on http://localthost using port 8000

When a user now browses to http://localhost:8000, index.html is loaded (served by ajax_server), 
index.html loads the ajax_client.js file with the JSON query logic.
